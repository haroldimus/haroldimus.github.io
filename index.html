            <ul class="squarelist">
              <li>“The figure of Rimbaud served as a kind of stand-in or proxy for the artist, inserted into places that mattered to David, place where he’d been or which still exerted a power over him.” (Laing 99-100)</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Comes to New York, decides to be an artist at the Met</li>

            </ul>
            <li>Tortuous parental situation</li>
            <ul class="squarelist">
              <li>“Another time, after a beating, he asked David to play with his penis. When David refused he dropped the subject, though the beating continued.” (Laing 101)</li>

            <ul class="squarelist">
              <li>“By fifteen he was regularly turning ten-dollar tricks in Times Square.” (Laing 103)</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Struggle with sexuality</li>
            <ul class="squarelist">
              <li>“This sense of separation, of being profoundly isolated by his past, was intensified by the old anxiety about sexuality. It had been agonizing, growing up in a world in which what he desired to do with his body was considered disgusting, tragic, deviant, deranged.” (Laing 106))</li>

          <ul class="squarelist">
            <li>“In Paris, he became close friends and soon lovers - openly gay behavior being very much a part of his project of self-exploration and defiance of society 0 with Verlaine, whose own poetry Rimbaud had already admired from a distance” (Davis)</li>

            <li>“I’ve periodically found myself in situations that felt desperate, and, in those moments, I’d feel that I needed to make certain things… I had Rimbaud come through a vague biographical outline of what my past had been- the places I had hung out in as a kid, the places I starved in or haunted on some level.” (Laing 100).</li>

        <h3>DONNING THE MASK</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="donningthemask">
        <ul>
          <li><b>Creating distance</b></li>
          <ul class="circlelistbold">
            <li>Donning the mask as driving force of performance</li>
            <ul class="squarelist">
              <li>“Donning and removing the performer’s mask in full view of spectators creates an instant transformation between performer and spectator… These moments turn and develop the action of the play in performance.”(Butterworth 33)</li>
            </ul>
            <li>This moment is revelatory to the identity of the performer</li>
            <ul class="squarelist">
              <li>“In plays, the moment of transformation reveals changed characteristics or identity of the personage.” (Butterworth 33)</li>
            </ul>
            <li>This transformation occurs within the context of an agreed pretense between performer and spectator…</li>
            <ul class="squarelist">
              <li>“Such changes are those experienced by the performer or spectator within the context of the ‘agreed pretence’ between player and spectator that are created during performance.” (Butterworth 33)</li>
            </ul>
            <li>… and this agreed pretense is dependent on the spectator’s knowledge of the performer/performance itself</li>
            <ul class="squarelist">
              <li>“The key factor that determines layers of pretence depends on answers to the following question: does the spectator know the identity of the player who wears the personage’s mask?” (Butterworth 35)</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Motives for mask in performance</li>
            <ul class="squarelist">
              <li>Simplest of which is to create an identity of a personage or creature that helps to condition the nature of the production or event (Butteroworth 35)</li>
              <li>Another motive may concern the conscious disguising of the player or personage so that his former identity is not recognized by other personages or spectators (Butterworth 35)</li>
              <ul class="squarelist">
                <li> Through the simple action of putting on the mask another represented personage is created. (Butterworth 35)</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
          <li>This reading suggests the meaning of the Rimbaud mask as a prison</li>
            <ul class="squarelistbold">
              <li>Wojnarowicz is only able to revisit traumatic sites by dawning the Rimbaud mask</li>
              <ul class="squarelist">
                <li>Laing: “Hard to imagine his Rimbaud being raped or forced to do anything against its will.” (Laing 109)</li>
              </ul>
                <li>Thus, the distance between Wojnarowicz of the present and of a traumatic past is too severe to be destroyed or overcome</li>
              </ul>
              <li>However...</li>
            </ul>
          <li><b>Destroying the distance<b></li>
          <ul class="circlelistbold">
            <li>The occasional use of the mask to subvert the aforementioned conventional meaning…</li>
            <ul class="squarelist">
              <li>““The masked personage or participant may deliberately attempt to weaken or subvert the convention by leaking clues as to his identity: in effect, teasing or provoking the spectator to engage in guesswork as to his identity.” (Butterworth 38)</li>
            </ul>
            <li>…and the curiosity it elicits from the spectator, thus engaging them in the performance</li>
            <ul class="squarelist">
              <li>“This possibility is a most powerful one in establishing the player/spectator relationship: it creates an active dynamic driven by spectator curiosity.” (Butterworth 38)</li>
              <li>“Analogous audience curiosity may also be seen in the perceived discrepancy between the player’s role and his known or presumed private life.” (Butterworth 38)</li>
            </ul>
            <li>This subversion changes the purpose of the mask from the concealment of the player to an exploration of the relationship between the disguise and the personage who dawns it</li>
            <li>Thus, when read in this way, Wojnarowicz uses the mask not to conceal, but to capitalize on the effect created by the interplay between the mask and the player</li>
            <ul class="squarelistbold">
              <li>Rimbaud mask is not an escape from traumatic past, but rather the representation of a figure whose mythology is analogous to the one Wojnarowicz wishes to create for himself</li>
              <ul class="squarelist">
                <li>Laing: “Was it a figure he could enter (as later, in his diary: ‘I want to create a myth that I can one day become’)…” (Laing 109)<li>
              </ul>
              <li>Thus, the distance between Wojnarowicz of the present and of the traumatic past has already been destroyed with Rimbaud as an aid</li>

            <ul class="squarelist">
              <li>Photography mostly discussed from two vantage points of Operator (photographer) and Spectator (viewer) (Evernden 72)</li>
              <ul class="squarelist">
                <li>Neither of these approaches likely to illuminate the experience of the third player, the target (Evernden 72)</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
            <li>Derived (in part) from Susan Sontag conception</li>
            <ul class="squarelistbold">
              <li>Predation as metaphor for “photographic seeing”</li>
              <ul class="squarelist">
                <li>Sontag: “… there is something predatory in the act of taking a picture. To photograph people is to violate them, by seeing them as they never seen themselves, by having knowledge of them they can never have; it turns people into objects that can be symbolically possessed.” (Evernden 73)</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Inevitably leads to objectification</li>
              <ul class="squarelist">
                <li>Sontag: “There is inevitably an objectification involved in the act of predation, although it is apt to be ignored in the presence of the more visible subsequent stages, pursuit and capture.” (Evernden 73)</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Objectification related to act of “othering”…</li>
              <ul class="squarelist">
                <li>“The ability of the “other” to reduce one to the status of an object has been discussed frequently. When a person perceives that he or she is being seen by another, subjectivity evaporates and the person becomes and object in the other’s world.” (Evernden 74)</li>
                <li><b>… and thus related to the (dismissal) of queer experience, consignment of queer individual to invisibility?</b></li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
            <li>Dive deeper into the metaphysics of photographic seeing: vision</li>
            <ul class="squarelistbold">
              <li>Hans Jonas conception</li>
              <ul class="squarelist">
                <li><b>Vision is acting of objectification, and enables us to manipulate</b></li>
                <ul class="squarelist">
                  <li>“[Vision]… gives us the world as something “out there,” significantly removed from ourselves and arrayed for our inspection and possible manipulation.” (Evernden 75)</li>
                </ul>
                <li><b>Related to Laing conception of Wojnarowicz’s art-making</b></li>
                <ul class="squarelist">
                  <li>“Sometimes you can change the psychic space, the landscape of the emotions, by carrying out actions in the physical world.” (Laing 108)</li>
                </ul>
                <li>“I supposed in a way that’s what art is certainly the near-magical art that Wojnarowicz would soon begin to make, as he turned increasingly from destruction to creation.” (Laing 108)</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
            <li>If vision is inherently objectifying, then photography is inevitably lacking empathetic connection between operator and subject, then…</li>
            <ul class="squarelist">
              <li>“If it is the case that the photographic act inevitably involves the erosion of reciprocity and the establishment of the photographer as an aggressively objectifying observer, then Sontag’s two metaphors seem extremely well chosen.” (Ev 75)</li>
            </ul>
            <li>… Wojnarowicz is using Arthur Rimbaud in New York to create distance between his present self and his traumatic past, relegating those events to the memories of a stranger</li>
            <ul class="squarelistbold">
              <li>On “public” image:</li>
              <ul class="squarelist">
                <li>John Berger, On Photography:</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>“There are photographs which belong to private experience and there are those (probably the majority) which are used publicly.” (Evernden 82)</li>
                  <li>“The publicly used photograph usually present the unknown… It offers… information severed from experience… If the publicly used photograph belongs anywhere, it belongs to the memory of a total stranger.”(Evernden 82)</li>
                </ul>
              </ul>
            <li>Therefore, Rimbaud acts as a tourist of the traumatic scenes in Wojnarowicz’s life, a mythologized figure who is strong enough to withstand their horror</li>
          </ul>
          <li>However…</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Destroying distance</li>
        <ul class="circlelistbold">
          <li>Purpose of Evernden’s paper is to explore the underlying assumption of Sontag’s “___” that photographic seeing is inevitably objectifying</li>
          <li>Vision as not inherently objectifying</li>
          <ul class="squarelist">
            <li><b>Don Ihde criticizes the reductionism rampant in aforementioned discussions on vision</b></li>
            <ul>
              <li>“He refers not only to the reduction of thought to vision, but to a second reductionist move which reduces vision to an objectifying gaze.” (Evernden 77)</li>
              <li>“He argues that nothing is essentially given in vision until it is informed by the intensions of the subject.” (Evernden 77)</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <li>Reconceptualization of photographic seeing as “responsive,” and in fact purposed toward revealing the subjectivity of the photograph’s target</li>
          <ul class="squarelistbold">
            <ul class="squarelist">
              <li>“The responsive photographer would be one who begins with the assumption of reciprocity, and who looks in order to provoke a statement, an assertion of subjectivity. And he would attempt to photograph that statement rather than the simple husk of the prey/object.” (Evernden 79)</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Related to Henri Cartier-Bresson’s stated mission as photographer</li>
            <ul class="squarelist">
              <li>“When Cartier-Bresson referred to the decisive moment of taking a picture he meant, I feel, the mirrored moment that expresses the object so as to evoke in the mind of the viewer significant and inner qualities.” (Evernden 78)</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <li>In fact, photographic seeing as self-portrait, as projection of operator onto the subject</li>
          <ul class="squarelistbold">
            <li>Dorothea Lange</li>
            <ul class="squarelist">
              <li>“Every image he sees, every photograph he takes, becomes in a sense a self-portrait. The portrait is made more meaningful by intimacy- an intimacy shared not only by the photographer with his subject but by the audience.” (Evernden 78)</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Minor White</li>
            <ul class="squarelist">
              <li>“The photographer projects himself into everything he sees, identifying himself with everything in order to know it and feel it better.” (Evernden 79)</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <li>Thus, suggests that Wojnarowicz is destroying the distance between his present self and his traumatic past, reclaiming the horror inflicted upon him by finding the inner feelings of that past self and giving those moments a “personal eternity”</li>
          <ul class="squarelistbold">
            <li>On “private” image:</li>
            <ul class="squarelist">
              <li>“The private photograph (portrait of mother, etc.) is appreciated and read in a context which is continuous with that from which the camera removed it. It is a memento from the same life being lived. Such a photograph remains surrounded by the very meaning from which it was severed… The photograph has crystallized a moment,bestowing a kind of personal eternity upon it.” (Evernden 82)</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Therefore, Rimbaud acts as bridge between the Wojnarowiczs of past and present, connecting them through the responsive photographic connection between operator and subject</li>

              <li>“… for those of us who have lived most of our lives with no validation at all from the dominant culture.” (Hennessy 31-32)</li>
            </ul>
            <li>The pressure to maintain one’s own invisibility</li>
            <ul class="squarelist">

            <li>Heteronormativity as something that can be seen through dominant social norms</li>
            <ul class="squarelist">
              <li>“By targeting heteronormativity rather than heterosexuality, queer theory and activism also acknowledge that heterosexuality is an institution that organizes more than just the sexual: it is socially pervasive, underlying myriad taken-for-granted norms that shape what can be seen, said, and valued.” (Hennessy 35-36)</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Furthermore, when visibility of sexual identity is achieved at all, it is usually subject to commodification in our capitalist/commodity culture</li>
            <ul class="squarelist">
              <li>“Visibility in commodity culture is in this sense a limited victory for gays who are welcome to be visible as consumer subjects but not as social subjects.” (Hennessy 32)</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Suggests a reading of Arthur Rimbaud in New York as Wojnarowicz highlighting his invisibility as a queer person, and thus continuing the anxiety that haunted his traumatic past</li>
            <ul class="squarelistbold">
              <li>Prevented from acknowledging his sexuality/ , he is unable to revisit the Wojnarowicz of the past, and continues to create distance</li>

            <ul class="squarelistbold">

              <ul class="squarelist">
                <li>“He had sex with the son of one of his mother’s friends and then thought frantically about killing him, almost hysterical with panic about his family finding out and sending him to an asylum, where he’d doubtless be given electric shock therapy.” (Laing 102-103)</li>

          <ul class="circlelistbold">
            <li>Judith Butler’s conception of identity as constituted by the value-system/collective understanding of the surrounding culture</li>
            <ul class="squarelist">
              <li>“Identity, then, is not a matter of a person’s experience, self-expression, or visible features but of “socially instituted and painted norms of intelligibility”” (Hennessy 37)</li>
              <ul class="squarelist">
                <li>“In this sense, gender intelligibility depends on certain presuppositions that the dominant knowledges safeguard or keep invisible.” (Hennessy 37)</li>

            </ul>
            <li>Judith Butler’s conception of drag as revealing the falsity of heteronormative gender system</li>
            <ul class="squarelist">
              <li>“Drag for Butler is not merely a matter of clothing or cross-dressing. It is a discursive practice that discloses the fabrication of identity through parodic repetitions of the heterosexual gender system.” (Hennessy 38)</li>
            </ul>
            <li>The apparent difference between the gender of the performer and the character they play is an act which demonstrates an awareness of the absurdity of dominant gender norms</li>
            <ul class="squarelist">
              <li>“Against the dominant reading of drag as a failed imitation or the “real thing,” Butler posits is as a subversive act. By turning a supposed bad copy of heterosexuality… against a way of thinking that posits heterosexuality as the real thing, drag exposes this pseudo-original as itself a copy or representation.” (Hennessy 38)</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Suggests a reading of Wojnarowicz’s project as creating visibility through the obvious failed imitation of Rimbaud</li>
            <ul class="squarelistbold">
              <li>Failed imitation evidenced by the two-dimensional, flimsy mask that Wojnarowicz uses</li>
              <li>While wearing the mask is not drag, the act of costuming and the self-awareness of the act has the effect of creating visibility, analogous to what Butler has described</li>
              <li>By approaching his traumatic past from a place secure in his sexuality, Wojnarowicz employs Arthur Rimbaud in New York series to reclaim that personal period from its horror, and thus destroys the distance between his past and present self</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Also congruent with Laing</li>
            <ul class="squarelistbold">

              <ul class="squarelist">
                <li>“He wanted to make images that told the truth, acknowledge the people left out of history or otherwise disenfranchised, excluded from the record.” (Laing 109)</li>
